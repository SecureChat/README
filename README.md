## README

Here is the motivation of this project.

Imagine you want to send your bank account number and its password to one of your relatives. What application will you use? Are you sure that the service provider will not monitor or leak your information?

Perhaps you will say that the application you are using is safe according to the service providers. Are they telling you they use end-to-end encryption or some other "fancy" techniques? Then try to answer this question, **"What if they add backdoors in their applications?"**

Since we cannot get access to the full code of current social platforms and instant message applications, a fully open sourced social platform may be the only answer.
